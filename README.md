# 🚀 AI Internship Journey — Sajeel Sahil

Welcome to my **AI Internship Journey Repository**, where I’ll be documenting every step of my hands-on learning and project development experience throughout this internship.  
This isn’t just a repo — it’s the digital notebook of my growth as an **AI Engineer in training**.

---

## 🌱 Overview

This repository will evolve as my internship progresses, showcasing a timeline of my learning and projects.  
Each **Task Folder** represents a new phase in the journey — exploring concepts from **basic AI tools** to **advanced intelligent agents**.

I’ll continuously update this repo as I move from foundational skills to building real-world AI systems.
