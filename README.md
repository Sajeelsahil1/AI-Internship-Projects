# 🎓 AI Internship Journey — Sajeel Sahil

This repository documents my complete **AI Internship Journey**, showcasing my growth and hands-on learning across multiple AI development tasks.  
Each **Task folder** represents a stage in the internship — from API integration to intelligent agent systems using LLMs and LangChain.

## 🧠 Internship Overview

During this internship, I explored how artificial intelligence can automate workflows, interact with real-world data, and assist in research.  
The program focused on:

- 🧩 **LLM Fundamentals** — Understanding prompt design, model responses, and reasoning.  
- 🔗 **API Integration** — Connecting AI models with live data sources (news, weather, email, etc.).  
- 🧠 **AI Agents & Automation** — Building small intelligent agents capable of decision-making.  
- ⚙️ **LangChain & Multi-Agent Systems** — Combining tools and reasoning for advanced use cases.  
- 💡 **Practical UI Implementation** — Creating Streamlit-based interactive dashboards for testing.
